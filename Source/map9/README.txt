Description

Idea:
This stage aims on resolving the myth which studying programming is difficult to understand and boring.  The game works like the App Inventor.  Players have to create a programming pair which contain a function frame and the inner code.  The program will only work the player match the correct frame-code pair.  The name of the frame and the code in the code part will be shown in a hight level way which player do not have to know any about coding while do the matching.
